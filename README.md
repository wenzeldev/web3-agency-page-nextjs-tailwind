# Web3 Agency Website

This project is a one-page portfolio website for showcasing the services and capabilities of a web3 agency. It utilizes modern web development technologies such as Tailwind CSS, Next.js, ESLint, and React.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs quickly. It was chosen for its flexibility and ease of use in styling components.

- **Next.js:** Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and simple deployment. It was selected for its robust features, including optimized performance and SEO benefits, which are crucial for a professional portfolio website.

- **ESLint:** ESLint is a static code analysis tool used for identifying and reporting patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. It helps maintain code quality and consistency throughout the project.

- **React:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was used to create interactive and dynamic components for the website.

## How the Project Was Created

1. **Project Setup:** The project was initialized with Next.js to take advantage of its powerful features like server-side rendering and routing. Next.js provides a structured environment for building React applications.

2. **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS was chosen for styling due to its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid development and easy customization. Tailwind's extensive set of utility classes simplified the styling process and ensured consistency across the website.

3. **Component Development:** React components were developed to create a cohesive and interactive user experience. Components were designed to be modular and reusable, promoting code efficiency and maintainability.

4. **Linting with ESLint:** ESLint was integrated into the project to enforce code quality standards and identify potential errors or inconsistencies in the codebase. It helps ensure clean and readable code, improving overall project maintainability.

5. **Deployment:** The website was deployed using appropriate hosting services, ensuring accessibility to users. Continuous deployment practices may be implemented to streamline the deployment process and ensure updates are quickly reflected on the live site.

# Next.js generated stuff 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
